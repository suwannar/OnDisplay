The Concept 
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Today, technology has made it easier than ever for us to share images, thoughts and things. The Information is being shared so fast that we need to work harder to maintain privacy. Our desire to be popular leads us to post on public forums. 
<br>
The rise of the use of selfie in today’s world is one perfect example for this increasingly narcissistic culture, where many have overlooked the control they have over their own images when exposing themselves online.
